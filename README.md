# Shared Stuff
## Share Real Stuff with Friends
With "Shared Stuff" you can edit a list of (real world) stuff that you own and share it with your friends. You can search and browse an aggregated view of all the stuff that your friends have.

##Save the World and Have Fun
Imagine you need an electric drill but don't want to buy one for the 2 holes you drill in one year. With Shared Stuff you can easily see who of your friends you can ask. You can also find inspirations for good books in your friend's list or discover an old unused sega game console for a fun retro gaming party ...

##You own your Data
The stuff you own is a valuable personal profile, that should not be on a central server you can't control. Your data in Shared Stuff will be saved in your remote storage account.
